## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Auto-binding
- Moderators: Automatically assigned as author (author_id = their user ID)
- Admins: Can select any user from dropdown

### 2. Permission System
- **Moderator**: Can CRUD own content, read-only access to published content from others
- **Admin**: Full CRUD on all content, can change author_id (transfer ownership)

### 3. Activity Logging
- **Create**: Logs author assignment
- **Update**: Logs normal updates
- **Transfer**: Logs author changes with old/new author details

### 4. Frontend UX
- Manual author/instructor fields removed
- Admin sees dropdown to select author
- Moderators don't see author field (auto-assigned)
- Product "author" field for books kept separate from "author_id" system

## Migration Instructions

To apply the database changes:
```bash
# On the server (user will run this)
php artisan migrate
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Moderator creates article → author_id = moderator's ID
- [ ] Admin creates article with dropdown → author_id = selected user
- [ ] Moderator tries to edit other's article → 403 error
- [ ] Admin edits article and changes author → Transfer logged
- [ ] Check ActivityLog has proper entries with metadata
- [ ] Verify author object returned in API responses
- [ ] Frontend dropdown shows only for admin
- [ ] Products migration runs successfully
- [ ] Author relationship works for all three content types
